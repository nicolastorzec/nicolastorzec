# About Me

✦ As Director of Data Science at Cardlytics, I lead Commerce AI initiatives. Using merchant metadata and first-party purchase data, my work focuses on commerce graph construction and transaction understanding. It powers Cardlytics' commerce media platform, enabling financial institutions and advertisers to offer relevant card-linked ads and rewards within bank digital channels. My role spans technical leadership, project management and people management.

✦ Previously, I was a director of Research Engineering at Yahoo where I led a group of researchers and engineers, spearheaded the development of the Yahoo Knowledge Graph, and drove ML/AI projects for Web Search and E-Commerce. Prior to that, as an individual contributor, I developed web mining systems for Yahoo Search, shopping comparison platforms for Kelkoo and natural language processing technologies for France Telecom's Voice R&D unit. I also worked as a lecturer and researcher in computer science at the University of Rennes, France.

✦ My areas of interest include machine learning, natural language processing, information extraction, data integration, knowledge graph construction and management, search, recommendation, and knowledge engineering. I have experience managing cross-functional teams and leading complex R&D projects.

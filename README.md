## Hi ðŸ‘‹

Nicolas Torzec here. I currently work at Yahoo as a Director of Research Engineering where I lead a team focused on ML/AI and Knowledge Graphs for Web Search and E-Commerce. You can reach out to me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolastorzec/). Occasionally, I'm also on [Twitter](https://x.com/nicolastorzec).

Beside working, I also swim, bike and run. 

*PS: This `github` is primarily for personal projects, which I keep private.*

# About Me

My name is Nicolas Torzec. I am a Director of Research Engineering at Yahoo where I research and develop technologies involving machine learning (ML/AI) and knowledge graphs (KG) for Web Search and E-Commerce.

Previously, I spearheaded the development of the Yahoo Knowledge Graph and related projects at Yahoo Labs. Prior to that, I developed web mining systems for Yahoo Search, shopping comparison platforms for Kelkoo and natural language processing technologies for France Telecom's Voice R&D unit. I also worked as a lecturer and researcher in computer science at the University of Rennes, France.

My areas of interest include machine learning, natural language processing, information extraction, data integration, knowledge graph construction and management, semantic search, entity recommendation and knowledge engineering.

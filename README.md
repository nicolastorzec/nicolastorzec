# About Me

✦ As Director of Data Science at Cardlytics, I lead a global R&D team that develops data and ML systems in charge of understanding transaction data from financial institutions, constructing and enriching our commerce graph from merchant and transaction data, and generating insights about brands and stores.

✦ Previously, I was a director of Research Engineering at Yahoo where I led the applied science team that developed Yahoo's knowledge graph and product graph, along with the search, recommendation and other ML/AI services built on top of them for Web Search and E-commerce. 

✦ Earlier, I spearheaded the development of Yahoo’s knowledge graph and novel search & recommendation systems at Yahoo Labs, built innovative web mining systems for Yahoo Search, developed online price comparison solutions for Kelkoo, and advanced natural language processing technologies for Orange R&D’s voice unit. I also served as a lecturer and researcher at the University of Rennes, France.

✦ My interests include machine learning, data science, information extraction, data integration, knowledge graphs, natural language processing, search & recommendation, transaction understanding, commerce graph, and knowledge engineering.

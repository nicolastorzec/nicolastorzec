## Welcome

My name is Nicolas Torzec. I work at Yahoo as a Director of Research Engineering where I lead a team focused on ML/AI and Knowledge Graphs for Web Search and E-Commerce. You can reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolastorzec/). Occasionally, I'm also on [~~Twitter~~ X](https://x.com/nicolastorzec).

*PS: This `github` is primarily for my personal projects, which I keep private.*

# About Me

As a Director of Research Engineering at Yahoo, I (my team) develop technologies and solutions leveraging ML/AI and knowledge graphs for Web Search and E-Commerce.

Previously, I spearheaded the development of Yahoo's knowledge graph and product graph, and worked on various problems related to them. Prior to that, I developed web mining systems for Yahoo Search, shopping comparison platforms for Kelkoo and natural language processing technologies for France Telecom's Voice R&D unit. I also worked as a lecturer and researcher in computer science at the University of Rennes, France.

My areas of interest include machine learning, natural language processing, information extraction, data integration, knowledge graph construction and management, content understanding, search, recommendation, and knowledge engineering.

I'm on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolastorzec/) and occasionally on [X ~~Twitter~~](https://x.com/nicolastorzec). 

*PS: This `github` is primarily for personal projects, which I keep private.*

# About Me

I am a Director of Research Engineering at Yahoo where I research and develop technologies involving ML/AI and knowledge graphs for Web Search and E-Commerce.

Previously, I spearheaded the development of the Yahoo Knowledge Graph focusing on information extraction, data integration, knowledge graph construction, semantic search, entity recommendation and content understanding. 

Prior to that, I developed web mining systems for Yahoo Search, shopping comparison platforms for Kelkoo and natural language processing technologies for France Telecom's Voice R&D unit. I also worked as a lecturer and researcher in computer science at the University of Rennes, France.

My areas of interest include machine learning, natural language processing, information extraction, data integration, large-scale knowledge graph construction and management, semantic search, entity recommendation and knowledge engineering.

# About Me

✦ At Cardlytics, I lead the development of AI, ML and data systems in charge of understanding transaction data from financial institutions, constructing and enriching our commerce graph from merchant and transaction data, and generating insights about brands and stores. 

✦ At Yahoo, I spearheaded and led the development of Yahoo's knowledge graph and product graph, and many search, recommendation and content understanding systems built on top of them for Web Search and E-commerce.

✦ Earlier in my career, I developed web mining and search &amp; recommendation systems for Yahoo Search, online price comparison solutions for Kelkoo, and natural language processing technologies for France Telecom R&D's voice unit. I also served as a lecturer and researcher at the University of Rennes, France.

✦ My interests include AI/ML, data science, information extraction, data integration, knowledge management, knowledge graphs, commerce graphs, search, recommendation, content understanding, and knowledge engineering. 

*PS: This `github` is primarily for personal projects, which I keep private.*

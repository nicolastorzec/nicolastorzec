# About Me

My name is Nicolas Torzec. I am a Director of Research Engineering at Yahoo where I drive research initiatives and develop technologies involving machine learning (ML/AI) and Knowledge Graphs (KG) for Web Search and E-Commerce. I lead a team of researchers and engineers who specialize in machine learning, web mining and large-scale data management.

Previously, I spearheaded the development of the Yahoo Knowledge Graph and worked on related projects at Yahoo Labs. Prior to that, I developed web mining systems for Yahoo Search, price comparison solutions for Kelkoo and natural language processing technologies for France Telecom's Voice R&D unit. I also worked as a lecturer and researcher in computer science  at the University of Rennes, France.

My areas of interest include machine learning, natural language processing, information extraction, data integration, knowledge graph construction, knowledge management, semantic search, entity recommendation and knowledge engineering.
